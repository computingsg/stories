I am an IT professional who has been working for IT more than 10 years. Currently, I am playing a functional consultant role in one web application prject which is built usiing Dynamics 365. It is a kind of big challenge to me as my major is C# .Net, lacking of knowledge of D365. But I do consider it a good opportunity which takes me out off my comfortable zone and leads me onto new areas.

I aspire to be a computiing teacher to teach kids computing related knowledge and develop their logical mindset, because I believe that learning computing will benefit their lives regardless if they work in the IT industry.

Nowadays, Python is one of the most popular computer language worldwide and it is the computer language that Singapore schools are using for computing teaching. Hence, being a Python teacher will be one way to achieve my dream. I wish I can be a computing teacher to teach kids Python one day!

However, I have appplied to MOE to be a teacher at least three times, but have not been shortlisted for any interview.
