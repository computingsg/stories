I am an IT professinal who has been working for IT more than 10 years. Currently, I am playing a function consultant role in one web application prject which is owned by EnterpriseSG and built by Dynamics 365. It is a kind of big challenging to me as my major is C# .Net, lack of knowledge of D365. But I do consider it a good opportunity which takes me out from my comfortable zone and leads me to a new area.
However, I have been always had one dream that to be a computiing teacher to teach kids computing related knowledge and make their mindset more logical. Becasue I believe that kinds who had learned computing, the mindset were trained will benifi them whole life although not all kids work on IT industry.

Nowadays, Python is one of the most popular computer language worldwide and it is the computer language that Singapore schoool is using it for computing teaching.
Hence, being a Python teacher will be one way to archive my dream.

Actually, I had touched Python many years ago. But I haven't passed beginer course on any website who provides lessions. Shame on me. (To be continued)
