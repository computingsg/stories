# A non computing JC1 student

I'm currently a JC 1 student, when I sat for the comuputing entrance test, I was not 1 of the 25 students selected. Although it was disheartening, I took it as a valuable lesson and continued to try out computing myself with the guidance of my father and a computing teacher from a school.

I'm currently studying
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Math
* Economics

In the future, I hope to be able to get into NUS School of Business and study Finance. I think that with computing, it can help develop my logical thinking and improve my creativity.
