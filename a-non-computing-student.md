# A non computing JC1 student

I'm currently a JC 1 student, when I sat for the comuputing entrance test, I was not 1 of the 25 students selected. Although it was disheartening, I took it as a valuable lesson and continued to try out computing myself with the guidance of my father and a computing teacher from a school.

I'm currently studying
* Physics
* Chemistry
* Math
* Economics

In the future, I hope to be able to get into NUS School of Business and study Finance. I think that with computing, it can help develop my logical thinking and improve my creativity.
Computing is something that can be learned individually or under guidance through teachers or websites such as Datacamp, allowing anyone interested to try out computing. I tried my hand at Datacamp, using softwares such as Python and through the beginner's course, 'Introduction to Python', I was able to familiarise myself more with the functions of Python. At the end of the course, not only did I receive a certificate, I also gained new skills, leaving me with a great sense of satisfaction.
